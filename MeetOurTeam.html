        <h3>Mark Cameron, PhD</h3>
        <p>Dr. Mark Cameron applies genomic technologies and bioinformatic methods to identify biomarkers (immune correlates) of infectious diseases, such as HIV, and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis. He and his team have broad computational expertise in analyzing across data types and studies, and focus their work on targets or diagnostics that can be used in specific immunotherapy or vaccine design. Dr. Cameron also directs the genomics activities of several large cores or consortia, including the Case Western Reserve University Applied Functional Genomics Core, the Miami Center for AIDS Research (Inter-CFAR) Bioinformatics Core, the Case Western Reserve University CFAR Systems Biology Core, and the international Early Treated Perinatally Infected individuals: Improving Childrenâ€™s Lives with an HIV Vaccine (EPIICAL). These collaborative cores allow Dr. Cameron to apply his systems approach and data from gene sequence, to gene transcription, to protein, cellular and antibody function, to find out what goes right or wrong in the immune systems of patients who respond variably to various diseases or treatments.

        <h3>Cheryl Cameron, PhD</h3>
        <p>Dr. Cheryl Cameron completed her Ph.D. in virology in the laboratory of Dr. Grant McFadden at Western University, computationally identifying novel viral immunomodulatory proteins such as the CD47 and CD200 homologues encoded by myxomavirus, a close relative of smallpox. She went on to pursue a post-doctoral fellowship in viral immunopathogenesis at the University of Toronto, applying transcriptomic analyses to dissect the host response to pathogenic respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and avian influenza virus to identify key determinants of severe outcome. Dr. Cameron has continued to study the complex interplay between the host and virus, using objective computational approaches to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and novel targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic interventions to improve the outcome in infected individuals. She went on to study chronic viral infection in people living with HIV, and has discovered that many of the host immune pathways that are highly dysregulated in viral infection are similarly dysregulated in cancer and in other diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure and psoriasis. Importantly, many of these pathways are metabolic in nature and are impacted by diet, nutrition, and drug abuse. Most recently, Dr. Cameron has revived her SARS coronavirus research program and is actively studying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in an effort to identify predictive biomarkers of disease severity as well as potential therapeutic targets to reverse the immune pathology seen in COVID-19. Dr. Cameron was excited to join the Department of Nutrition in 2019 as a translational researcher, and is happy to discuss opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in her research program, either by assisting in the analysis of big data, or by performing wet lab research.

<h3>Brian Richardson</h3>
<p>
(born July 14, 1986[8]) is the one of the ten main characters of the animated franchise of the same name. He was designed by the former marine biologist, Stephen Hillenburg. Hillenburg based SpongeBob on Bob the Sponge, a character he had created for his educational book "The Intertidal Zone" in the late 1980s.
SpongeBob is a childish, joyful, and clumsy sea sponge who lives in a pineapple with his pet snail Gary in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a job which he is exceptionally skilled at and enjoys thoroughly. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and his greatest dream in life is to receive his boating license. Unfortunately, he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves to hang out with his best friend Patrick. His driving teacher is Mrs. Puff and his boss is Mr. Krabs.
In The SpongeBob Musical, SpongeBob's exact species of sea sponge is identified: Aplysina fistularis, a yellow sea sponge who's commonly found in open waters.[9]
SpongeBob or some other form of him appears or is mentioned in every episode of the series, beginning with the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted." He is voiced by Tom Kenny, who is married to Karen Plankton's voice actress, Jill Talley.

  <h3>Ching-Wen Lin (Wendy)</h3>
  <p>Wendy's began on November 15, 1969, when the company's founder, Dave Thomas, opened his first restaurant. It was located at 257 East Broad Street, in Columbus, Ohio. Thomas chose the name Wendy's in honor of his daughter. He wanted to provide his customers with fast, hearty food, in a family setting. One year later, Thomas opened a second restaurant, also in Columbus. This eatery had the first modern drive-thru window among fast food restaurants.
Wendy's grew quickly after the opening of this second restaurant. By 1976, Wendy's had opened or franchised five hundred restaurants, including some in Canada. Two years later, the company had topped one thousand restaurants, and by 1979, the firm operated more than 1,500 eateries, including some in Mexico. Also in 1979, Wendy's was the first fast food restaurant to introduce a salad bar. The company continued to add approximately five hundred restaurants each year during the early 1980s.
During the 1990s, Wendy's continued to expand, operating over six thousand Wendy's restaurants by 2001. In 1996, the company purchased Tim Horton's. Expanding its holdings even further, in 2002, the firm purchased Baja Fresh Mexican Grill. In 2001, the company also became the sponsor of a Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament in Columbus, Ohio. The firm's growth was partly due to its creative advertising. In 1984, the company introduced its "Where's the Beef" campaign, which made fun of other restaurants' hamburgers. This phrase became a catchphrase for Americans during the mid 1980s. Dave Thomas also starred in most of Wendy's commercials from the late 1980s until his death in 2002. Customers identified with Thomas and his pledge to provide them with high-quality food.

Oscar the Grouch puppet made by Muppets, Inc. for the Children's Television Workshop for use in the production of the television series Sesame Street, ca. 1970-1980. Oscar is a green furry monster who lives in a trash can on Sesame Street and frequently argues with the other Muppet and human characters. Despite his grouchiness, Oscar is a valued friend to the other characters on Sesame Street, demonstrating the importance of understanding, tolerance, and diversity.
Oscar the Grouch was originally performed by Caroll Spinney, who said that he based the character's voice on a cranky New York taxi driver. Jim Hensonâ€™s inspiration for the character was a rude waiter at a restaurant named Oscar's Salt of the Sea. In his original concept drawings for Oscar the Grouch, Henson imagined a spiky, grumpy-looking magenta monster. Due to the limitations of early color television, however, Oscar was redesigned with orange fur for his premiere on the first season of Sesame Street in 1969, and only changed to green for the second season. Oscar explained that this change was due to his vacation at Swamp Mushy Muddy where it was so damp that he became covered in slime and mold.
Oscar the Grouch is a live-hand puppet, which means that one of the performerâ€™s hands is in the puppetâ€™s head while the other is in one of the puppetâ€™s arms, which has gloves for hands. Another puppeteer is usually needed to operate the other arm, which is known as right-handing. This particular Oscar the Grouch puppet was built in the 1970s. It was also used to perform the character Grandpa Grouch at some point in the show's run.

  Neo was born as one of the billions of bluepills connected to the Matrix where he was known as Thomas A. Anderson. As Thomas Anderson, he was a "normal citizen with a social security number" who held a day job as a computer programmer for the MetaCortex software company. However, outside of this persona, he worked as a hacker selling contraband programming under the alias, Neo, which he later adopts as his common-use name once he got freed from the Matrix.
One night, while waiting for a client to pick up contraband software, Neo was conducting an extensive online and periodical search for mentions of "Morpheus". The search gets interrupted and, blacking out his screen, a message read: "The Matrix has you..." then replaced by "Follow the white rabbit."
Neo tried to restore his computer to normal before a final message displayed and read: "Knock, knock, Neo". A banging is promptly heard from Neo's door as his client, Choi, accompanied by his girlfriend, Dujour, come searching for Neo.  Neo transacted with them, taking two discs containing some unrevealed programming from his secret stash, a hollowed-out copy of Simulacra and Simulation. Noticing how Neo was looking pale, Choi invited Neo along for a night of partying at a nearby club. Neo refused initially--until he spotted a white rabbit tattoed on Dujour's arm. Remembering the message on his computer, Neo decided to tag along. At the club, Neo met the mysterious message sender, who introduced herself as Trinity. Neo recognized the name as that belonging to a famous hacker that cracked the IRS D-base. Surprised that the infamous wizard-class hacker was a woman, Trinity confirmed how most guys tended to share the misconception. She also confirmed his suspicions about the world, alluding to the Matrix, hinting to more clues and adding confusion to his search for the truth.
